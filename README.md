- **Frontend:** SvelteKit
- **APIs:** RESTful
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes? maybe overkill
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Features
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Sign-up, login, and logout functionalities
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Real-time data visualization with customizable charts and graphs
   - User-friendly interface and responsive design

3. **Metrics & Monitoring:**
   - Collection and visualization of performance metrics
   - Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for detailed insights

4. **Alerting:**
   - Configurable alerts for critical events
   - Notification via email, Slack, and other channels

5. **Logging:**
   - Centralized log aggregation using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Search, filter, and analyze logs in real-time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Docker
- Kubernetes (optional)
- MongoDB (or any other DBMS)

    cd project-name
    ```

2. **Backend:**
    - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
      ```sh
      cd backend
      npm install
      ```

    - Set up environment variables `.env`:
      ```
      DB_URL=your-database-url
      JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

      npm start
      ```

4. **Containerization (Docker):**
    - Build and run the docker images:
      ```sh
      docker-compose up --build
      ```

5. **Monitoring & Logging:**
    - Set up Prometheus and Grafana using provided configuration files in the `monitoring` directory.
    - Set up ELK Stack using provided configuration files in the `logging` directory.
